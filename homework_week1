1.Would it be possible using the concatenated predicate to get any pair of consecutive numbers from a list? If so, How would you have to use the concatenated predicate to get it?

A: I think it's posible, but I don't know how to do.

2.Is it possible to make a reversible use of the invert predicate? If not possible, could you justify why?

A: Yes, it is. I tried and prolog answers that:

invertir(L2, [3,4,5]).
L2 = [5, 4, 3]

3.It would be able to indicate which characteristic makes a predicate not reversible.

A: Maybe when the result it ins't of the same type of the other arguments, such as in the predicate num_elements. We have a list agurment and the result it's a number. 

4.As we have seen in class, the reversible use of predicates is a very powerful feature of Prolog. Make use of a combination of the concatenate and invert predicates in which this technique is used.

A: I can't do.
