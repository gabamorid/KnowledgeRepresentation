1.Would it be possible using the concatenated predicate to get any pair of consecutive numbers from a list? If so, How would you have to use the concatenated predicate to get it?

A: Yes. 

append( ,[E1,E2| ], [1,2,3,4,5]).

2.Is it possible to make a reversible use of the invert predicate? If not possible, could you justify why?

A: Yes, it is. I tried and prolog answers that:

invertir(L2, [3,4,5]).
L2 = [5, 4, 3]

3.It would be able to indicate which characteristic makes a predicate not reversible.

A: When we use the operation "is".

4.As we have seen in class, the reversible use of predicates is a very powerful feature of Prolog. Make use of a combination of the concatenate and invert predicates in which this technique is used.

A:
